abstract = {Chromatin folding determines the accessibility of DNA constituting eukaryotic genomes and consequently is profoundly important in the mechanisms of nuclear processes such as gene regulation. Nucleosome arrays compact to form a 30-nanometer chromatin fiber of hitherto disputed structure. Two competing classes of models have been proposed in which nucleosomes are either arranged linearly in a one-start higher order helix or zigzag back and forth in a two-start helix. We analyzed compacted nucleosome arrays stabilized by introduction of disulfide cross-links and show that the chromatin fiber comprises two stacks of nucleosomes in accord with the two-start model.

  abstract = {The role of each histone tail in regulating chromatin structure is
	elucidated by using a coarse-grained model of an oligonucleosome
	incorporating flexible histone tails that reproduces the conformational
	and dynamical properties of chromatin. Specifically, a tailored configurational-bias
	Monte Carlo method that efficiently samples the possible conformational
	states of oligonucleosomes yields positional distributions of histone
	tails around nucleosomes and illuminates the nature of tail/core/DNA
	interactions at various salt milieus. Analyses indicate that the
	H4 histone tails are most important in terms of mediating internucleosomal
	interactions, especially in highly compact chromatin with linker
	histones, followed by H3, H2A, and H2B tails in decreasing order
	of importance. In addition to mediating internucleosomal interactions,
	the H3 histone tails crucially screen the electrostatic repulsion
	between the entering/exiting DNA linkers. The H2A and H2B tails distribute
	themselves along the periphery of chromatin fibers and are important
	for mediating fiber/fiber interactions. A delicate balance between
	tail-mediated internucleosomal attraction and repulsion among linker
	DNAs allows the entering/exiting linker DNAs to align perpendicular
	to each other in linker-histone deficient chromatin, leading to the
	formation of an irregular zigzag-folded fiber with dominant pair-wise
	interactions between nucleosomes i and i {+/-} 4.},

	Microsatellites are found both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including
	humans, wherein they appear scattered almost at random throughout
	the genome. Although in prokaryotes distinct biological functions
	have been demonstrated, the role of microsatellites in eukaryotes
	is less clear. Nevertheless, several interesting hypotheses exist
	suggesting that certain microsatellites may exert subtle influences
	on the regulation of gene expression. Although the presence of these
	subtle mechanisms may be beneficial to a whole population, when they
	go wrong, as is thought to happen in the case of human trinucleotide
	repeat associated diseases, such as Huntington's disease, the consequences
	for the individual can be fatal. Most human microsatellites probably
	have no biological use at all; however, they are extremely useful
	in such fields as forensic DNA profiling and genetic linkage analysis,
	which can be used to search for genes involved in a wide range of
	disorders. With a primary focus on humans, it is the aim of this
	review to present an up to date discussion, both of the biological
	aspects and scientific uses of microsatellite sequences. In the latter

	its behavior under load. Since in vivo myosin-V colocalizes with
	other much stronger motors like kinesins, its behavior under superstall
	forces is especially relevant. We used optical tweezers with a long-range
	force feedback to study myosin-V motion under controlled external
	forward and backward loads over its full run length. We find the
	mean step size remains constant at [~]36 nm over a wide range of
	forces from 5 pN forward to 1.5 pN backward load. We also find two
	force-dependent transitions in the chemomechanical cycle. The slower
	ADP-release is rate limiting at low loads and depends only weakly
	on force. The faster rate depends more strongly on force. The stronger
	force dependence suggests this rate represents the diffusive search
	of the leading head for its binding site. In contrast to kinesin
	motors, myosin-V's run length is essentially independent of force
	between 5 pN of forward to 1.5 pN of backward load. At superstall
	forces of 5 pN, we observe continuous backward stepping of myosin-V,

	predicts that the unzipped length as a function of time is characterized
	by jumps during which the strands separate rapidly, followed by long
	pauses where the number of separated base pairs remains constant.
	Here, we report previously uncharacterized observations of this striking
	behavior carried out on a number of identical single molecules simultaneously.
	When several single [lambda] phage molecules are subject to the same
	applied force, the pause positions are reproducible in each. This
	reproducibility shows that the positions and durations of the pauses
	in unzipping provide a sequence-dependent molecular fingerprint.
	For small forces, the DNA remains in a partially unzipped state for
	at least several hours. For larger forces, the separation is still
	characterized by jumps and pauses, but the double-stranded DNA will
	completely unzip in less than 30 min.},

	(motion of a viscous fluid induced by that of a wall bounding the
	fluid), we consider the motion of a polymer, one end of which is
	moved in an impulsive or oscillatory way. Analytical solutions for
	the time-dependent shapes of such moving polymers are obtained within
	an analysis applicable to small-amplitude deformations. In the case
	of oscillatory driving, particular attention is paid to a characteristic
	length determined by the frequency of oscillation, the polymer persistence
	length, and the viscous drag coefficient. Experiments on actin filaments
	manipulated with optical traps confirm the scaling law predicted
	by the analysis and provide a new technique for measuring the elastic
	bending modulus. Exploiting this model, we also present a reanalysis
	of several published experiments on microtubules.}

	complexes in which the DNA is often bent or sharply kinked. Kinetics
	measurements of DNA bending when in complex with the protein are
	essential for understanding the molecular mechanism that leads to
	precise recognition of specific DNA-binding sites. Previous kinetics
	measurements on several DNA-bending proteins used stopped-flow techniques
	that have limited time resolution of few milliseconds. Here we use
	a nanosecond laser temperature-jump apparatus to probe, with submillisecond
	time resolution, the kinetics of bending/unbending of a DNA substrate
	bound to integration host factor (IHF), an architectural protein
	from Escherichia coli. The kinetics are monitored with time-resolved
	FRET, with the DNA substrates end-labeled with a FRET pair. The temperature-jump
	measurements, in combination with stopped-flow measurements, demonstrate
	that the binding of IHF to its cognate DNA site involves an intermediate
	state with straight or, possibly, partially bent DNA. The DNA bending
	rates range from {approx}2 ms-1 at {approx}37{degrees}C to {approx}40
	ms-1 at {approx}10{degrees}C and correspond to an activation energy
	of {approx}14 {+/-} 3 kcal/mol. These rates and activation energy
	are similar to those of a single A:T base pair opening inside duplex
	DNA. Thus, our results suggest that spontaneous thermal disruption
	in base-paring, nucleated at an A:T site, may be sufficient to overcome
	the free energy barrier needed to partially bend/kink DNA before
	forming a tight complex with IHF.}

  abstract = {The two strands of a DNA molecule with a repetitive sequence can pair
	into many different basepairing patterns. For perfectly periodic
	sequences, early bulk experiments of Porschke indicate the existence
	of a sliding process, permitting the rapid transition between different
	relative strand positions. Here, we use a detailed theoretical model
	to study the basepairing dynamics of periodic and nearly periodic
	DNA. As suggested by Porschke, DNA sliding is mediated by basepairing
	defects (bulge loops), which can diffuse along the DNA. Moreover,
	a shear force f on opposite ends of the two strands yields a characteristic
	dynamic response: An outward average sliding velocity v [~] 1/N is
	induced in a double strand of length N, provided f is larger than
	a threshold fc. Conversely, if the strands are initially misaligned,
	they realign even against an external force f < fc. These dynamics
	effectively result in a viscoelastic behavior of DNA under shear
	forces, with properties that are programmable through the choice
	of the DNA sequence. We find that a small number of mutations in
	periodic sequences does not prevent DNA sliding, but introduces a
	time delay in the dynamic response. We clarify the mechanism for
	the time delay and describe it quantitatively within a phenomenological
	model. Based on our findings, we suggest new dynamical roles for
	DNA in artificial nanoscale devices. The basepairing dynamics described
	here is also relevant for the extension of repetitive sequences inside
	genomic DNA.}

	to dissect the complex formation process into its component binding
	and bending reaction steps, using stopped-flow fluorimetry to observe
	changes in resonance energy transfer between DNA-bound dyes, which
	in turn reflect distance changes upon bending. Different DNA substrates
	that are likely to increase or decrease the DNA bending rate were
	studied, including one with a nick in a critical kink position, and
	a substrate with longer DNA ends to increase hydrodynamic friction
	during bending. Kinetic experiments were carried out under pseudofirst-order
	conditions, in which the protein concentration is in substantial
	excess over DNA. At lower concentrations, the reaction rate rises
	linearly with protein concentration, implying rate limitation by
	the bimolecular reaction step. At high concentrations the rate reaches
	a plateau value, which strongly depends on temperature and the nature
	of the DNA substrate. We ascribe this reaction limit to the DNA bending
	rate and propose that complex formation is sequential at high concentration:
	IHF binds rapidly to DNA, followed by slower DNA bending. Our observations
	on the bending step kinetics are in agreement with results using
	the temperature-jump kinetic method.}

  abstract = {Myosin V is a double-headed molecular motor involved in organelle
	transport. Two distinctive features of this motor, processivity and
	the ability to take extended linear steps of {approx}36 nm along
	the actin helical track, depend on its unusually long light chain-binding
	domain (LCBD). The LCBD of myosin V consists of six tandem IQ motifs,
	which constitute the binding sites for calmodulin (CaM) and CaM-like
	light chains. Here, we report the 2-A resolution crystal structure
	of myosin light chain 1 (Mlc1p) bound to the IQ2-IQ3 fragment of
	Myo2p, a myosin V from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This structure,
	combined with FRET distance measurements between probes in various
	CaM-IQ complexes, comparative sequence analysis, and the previously
	determined structures of Mlc1p-IQ2 and Mlc1p-IQ4, allowed building
	a model of the LCBD of myosin V. The IQs of myosin V are distributed
	into three pairs. There appear to be specific cooperative interactions
	between light chains within each IQ pair, but little or no interaction
	between pairs, providing flexibility at their junctions. The second
	and third IQ pairs each present a light chain, whether CaM or a CaM-related
	molecule, bound in a noncanonical extended conformation in which
	the N-lobe does not interact with the IQ motif. The resulting free
	N-lobes may engage in protein-protein interactions. The extended
	conformation is characteristic of the single IQ of myosin VI and
	is common throughout the myosin superfamily. The model points to
	a prominent role of the LCBD in the function, regulation, and molecular
	interactions of myosin V.}

  abstract = {The abbreviated name, mfold web server', describes a number of closely
	related software applications available on the World Wide Web (WWW)
	for the prediction of the secondary structure of single stranded
	nucleic acids. The objective of this web server is to provide easy
	access to RNA and DNA folding and hybridization software to the scientific
	community at large. By making use of universally available web GUIs
	(Graphical User Interfaces), the server circumvents the problem of
	portability of this software. Detailed output, in the form of structure
	plots with or without reliability information, single strand frequency
	plots and energy dot plots', are available for the folding of single
	sequences. A variety of bulk' servers give less information, but
	in a shorter time and for up to hundreds of sequences at once. The
	portal for the mfold web server is http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold.
	This URL will be referred to as MFOLDROOT'.}
